            <p>Giraffes, known for their towering height and distinctive spots, are often associated with the "Big Five" of African wildlife. However, the traditional Big Five—lion, leopard, rhinoceros, elephant, and Cape buffalo—are more commonly targeted in safari tourism. Despite not being part of the Big Five, giraffes are a beloved sight for wildlife enthusiasts, offering a unique and gentle giant experience in their natural habitat.</p>

            <h2>Climate Change and Its Impact on Giraffes</h2>
            <img src="image.png" alt="Giraffe in changing environment">
            <p>Climate change poses significant challenges to giraffes, affecting their habitats and food sources. Rising temperatures and shifting weather patterns lead to habitat loss and altered vegetation growth, which can impact giraffe populations. Conservation efforts are crucial in addressing these issues and ensuring that giraffes continue to thrive in a rapidly changing world.</p>

            <h2>Understanding Giraffe Anatomy</h2>
            <img src="image.png" alt="Diagram of giraffe anatomy">
            <p>Giraffes are fascinating creatures with unique anatomical features. Their long necks, which can reach up to 18 feet, are supported by only seven vertebrae—just like humans. This remarkable adaptation allows them to reach high branches and leaves that are inaccessible to other herbivores. Their specialized digestive system helps them process tough vegetation efficiently.</p>

            <h2>Giraffe Behavior and Social Structure</h2>
            <p>Giraffes are social animals that live in loose herds, often consisting of females and their young, or males in smaller bachelor groups. Their behavior includes unique interactions such as necking, where males engage in ritualized combat by swinging their necks at each other. These interactions help establish dominance and secure mating rights. Understanding their social dynamics offers insights into their complex and graceful existence.</p>
